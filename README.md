# Crime-Rate-Prediction

Crime analysis is crucial for upholding law and order as well as for ensuring public safety.
The conventional crime data analysis techniques are inefficient and not predictive. With the
development in machine learning and data analytics, crime prediction systems have become
increasingly popular. This project will create a web-based crime prediction and
visualization platform that utilizes past crime data to determine patterns, forecast crime
trends in the future, and aid resource allocation for law enforcement organizations.

**Implementation**

The project has a web interface where a user can choose a city, type of crime, and year to
get crime predictions. The system architecture is as follows:

This project offers a crime analysis and forecast platform that improves the decisionmaking process in law enforcement. Using machine learning and visualization, it enhances
the analysis of crime trends and facilitates proactive crime prevention. Additional
improvements can raise accuracy and real-time data integration, and hence becomes a
useful tool for public safety
